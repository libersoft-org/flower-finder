Bugs:

- Game over alert is shown multiple times for some reason
- When using magnifier, it collects items at black spots too (which should not)

Other:

- Show all positions of flowers when the game is over - checkGameEnd
- Shrink fields on mobile low resolutions
- Add rules text at start
- Add game screenshot (screenshot.webp) for README
- Revealed and blocked (both together) should appear to other player as some very dark gray
- Remake field rendering in startGame (`repeat(${settings.gridSize}, 40px)` ...)
